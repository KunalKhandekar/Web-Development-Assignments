    <h1>Web Design</h1>
    <p>Web design is a creative discipline that focuses on the visual and interactive aspects of websites. It involves
        the aesthetic arrangement of elements, user interface (UI) design, and user experience (UX) considerations to
        create engaging and intuitive online experiences. Web designers are responsible for the look, feel, and
        functionality of websites, ensuring they are visually appealing, user-friendly, and aligned with the goals of
        the project.</p>
    <p>One of the key elements of web design is visual aesthetics. Designers use their creativity and knowledge of color
        theory, typography, and layout principles to create visually pleasing and harmonious designs. They carefully
        choose colors, fonts, and imagery that reflect the brand identity and effectively convey the desired message to
        the target audience. Through a combination of graphics, icons, and visuals, they create a visually cohesive and
        engaging user interface.</p>
