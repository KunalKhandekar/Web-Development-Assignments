    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <p>Web development is a dynamic and ever-evolving field that encompasses the creation, design, and maintenance of
        websites and web applications. It brings together various technologies, programming languages, and frameworks to
        deliver engaging and functional online experiences. Web developers are the architects behind the scenes,
        crafting the digital landscapes that we interact with every day.</p>
    <p>At the core of web development lies HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which provides the structure and content of
        web pages. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) enhances the visual presentation, allowing developers to customize the
        layout, colors, and fonts. JavaScript, a powerful scripting language, adds interactivity and dynamic features to
        websites, enabling elements such as forms, animations, and responsive behavior.</p>
