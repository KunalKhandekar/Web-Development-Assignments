    <h1>Comments</h1>
    <p>HTML comments don't get displayed in the browser. This means that any comments you add to your HTML source code
        will not be shown when the document gets rendered in a web browser. That being said, keep in mind that anyone
        can view the source code of practically every website published on the Internet by going to View -> Developer ->
        View Source and this also includes all comments!. So your comments will be visible for others to see if you make
        the HTML document public and they choose to look at the source code. Writing comments is helpful and it's a good
        practice to follow when writing source code. Comments help you document and communicate about your code and
        thought process to yourself (and others). It also reminds you what you were thinking/doing when you come back to
        a project after months of not working on it. Comments also help you communicate with other developers who are
        working on the project with you. Your comments can clearly explain to them why you added certain lines of code.
