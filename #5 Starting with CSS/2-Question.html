    <h1>Information on CSS</h1>
    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a powerful styling language used to control the appearance and layout of web pages. It works alongside HTML and XML to separate the content and presentation layers of a document. CSS allows you to define styles for individual elements or groups of elements, making it easier to apply consistent design across multiple web pages.</p>
    <p>In CSS, styles are specified using selectors, which target specific elements in an HTML or XML document. Selectors can be based on element types, classes, IDs, attributes, and more. For example, you can target all <code>&gt;p&lt;</code> elements or only those with a specific class.</p>
    <p>Once a selector is defined, you can apply various style properties to it. CSS offers a wide range of properties to control aspects such as font size, color, margin, padding, background, border, and more. These properties are set using property-value pairs. For instance, you can set the font size to 16 pixels or the background color to blue.</p>
    <p> CSS also provides the concept of cascading, which determines the priority of conflicting styles. Multiple CSS rules can apply to the same element, and the order of the rules, selector specificity, and use of the !important declaration can influence which styles take precedence.</p>
    <p>One of the key advantages of CSS is its ability to create responsive web designs. Media queries allow you to apply different styles based on factors such as screen size, orientation, or resolution. This enables websites to adapt their layout and appearance to different devices, providing an optimal user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.</p>
