    <!-- 8. Create a simple webpage with semantic HTML which has the header, main, and footer sections. The header section must contain links to navigate to different sections of the webpage. The main section must contain three subsections about what is HTML. What is Semantic HTML and a list of commonly used semantic tags? In the end, the footer section must contain your name. -->

            <h2>About HTML</h2>
            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating webpages and web applications. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web and is used to structure and present content on the internet.</p>
            <p>HTML utilizes a set of tags or elements that define the structure and semantics of the content. These tags consist of opening and closing angle brackets, enclosing the content they affect. Elements can include headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, tables, and more.</p>
            <p>By using HTML, web developers can define the hierarchical structure of a webpage, including headings, paragraphs, sections, and other elements. They can also add hyperlinks, media, forms, and interactive elements to create a rich and interactive user experience.</p>
            <p>HTML is an evolving language, and different versions have been released over time. The latest version is HTML5, which introduced new features and elements that enhance the capabilities of development.</p>
            <p>Understanding HTML is essential for anyone involved in creating or maintaining websites, as it forms the backbone of web content and enables effective communication of information and data across the internet.

            <h2>Semantic HTML</h2>
            <p>Semantic HTML refers to the use of specific HTML tags that convey meaning and structure to the content. Instead of using generic div or span elements, semantic tags provide descriptive and meaningful names that define the purpose of the content they contain.</p>
            <p>By using semantic tags, developers can improve the accessibility, search engine optimization, and maintainability of webpages. Semantic tags help assistive technologies, such as screen readers,understand the structure and context of the content, making it more accessible to individuals with disabilities.</p>
            <p>Search engines also benefit from semantic HTML, as the use of descriptive tags provides clearer indicators of the content's relevance. This can potentially improve search engine rankings and visibility.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, semantic HTML improves the maintainability of webpages. By using tags that accurately represent the content, it becomes easier for developers to understand and update the structure of the webpage. This promotes code reusability and reduces the need for excessive div and class attributes.</p>
            <p>Some commonly used semantic tags include the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> tag for introductory or navigational sections, the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tag for navigation menus, the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag for the main content of the webpage, the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tag for standalone sections, and the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> tag for closing sections.</p>
            <p>By embracing semantic HTML, developers can create webpages that are more accessible, optimized for search engines, and easier to maintain, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience.</p>
